# Python Introduction: Building a Weather Application using OpenWeather's API

## About
For this project, OpenWeather's API was used to build a simple application that retrieves weather forecasts for a particular address or zip code. The app allows users to input a location and view real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience working with APIs, handling JSON data, and integrating external data sources into user-friendly applications while demonstrating a grasp of the basics of the Python programming language.
